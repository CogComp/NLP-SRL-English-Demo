Beautiful etymology behind this.  During the Industrial Revolution in
France, disgruntled (and displaced) workers would toss their wooden
shoes, called "sabot"s, into the machinery of the new factories,
naturally causing the machinery to break.  This kind of willful
destruction came to be called sabot-age.
