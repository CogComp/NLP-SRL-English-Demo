    That impressed Robert B. Pamplin, Georgia-Pacific's chief
    executive at the time, whom Mr. Hahn had met while *trace*
    fundraising for the institute.

<note>
Ordinarily this would be "so-and-so raised funds for X" with "funds" in the
arg1 position, but "funds" has been glommed onto the verbs itself and
so cannot exist as an independent arg.  For consistency, though, the
beneficiary is left in arg2.
