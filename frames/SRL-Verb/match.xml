    The company matched Kodak's higher prices.
  </text>
  <arg n="0">The company</arg>
  <rel      >matched</rel>
  <arg n="1">Kodak's higher prices</arg>
</example>

<note>
(The idea in (6) above is that the second Arg1 (presumably the company's prices)
 is unstated but fairly easily recoverable.  This happens a lot in real usage.)
</note>

<note>
The matched items all have the same status as arguments/semantic roles. 
This can be seen from the fact that they can be expressed conjointly, as
in sentences 3,4. (This is similar to reciprocals like John kissed Mary/
John and Mary kissed) and also byt the fact that (5a) and (5b) have the 
same meaning. 
There is a difference with respect to Figure/Ground 
mapping (sentence 2), but the PA tagger does not provide for this. 
</note>

<note>
There are passives

(6a) The paint is matched (by the wallpaper)
(6b) The wallpaper is matched (by the paint)

but these are adjectival, not verbal, as the tests show: 

The paint was unmatched 
The paint is well matched
*At noon, the paint was matched my the wallpaper

Therefore, (6) are predicative sentences, and the participle is 
an adjective, just like "peeling." So the (optional) by-phrase 
is an adverbial; the noun in the by-phrase is not an A0 (agent) 
argument.

(6a) The paint is [matched (by the wallpaper)]
                   AdjP
(6b) The wallpaper is [matched (by the paint)]
                      AdjP 

(And therefore these cases are not to be tagged--Paul)
