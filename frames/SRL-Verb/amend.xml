    The company said it amended its shareholder rights plan by
    reducing to 10% from 20% the level of ownership by an outsider
    that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy
    additional shares of Nashua common at half price.

<note>
It's possible that the MNR above should be regarded as an instrument
and therefore take a numbered argument (arg3, probably), but I don't
think an instrument/"amendment" will actually occur all that often,
and it actually sounds a little weird to me.  We'll see.

    PS of New Hampshire amended its plan to call for two years of 5.5%
    rate increases followed by five years of 4.5% increases.

        <arg n="2" f="PRD">to call for two years of 5.5% rate
        increases followed by five years of 4.5% increases</arg> 
</example>

<note>
I read the latter sentence as the plan now calls for such-and-such
increases, not that PS amended its plan in order to call for the
increases.  It's subtle.
