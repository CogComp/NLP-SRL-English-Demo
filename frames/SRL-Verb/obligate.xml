    Thus, an institution obligated *trace* to make fixed-rate interest
    payments on debt swaps the payments with another making
    floating-rate payments.

<note>
The only difference between 'oblige' and 'obligate' is that the latter
can only occur in the passive.  The former also prefers the passive,
though.
