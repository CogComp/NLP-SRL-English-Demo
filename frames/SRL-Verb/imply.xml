    As their name implies, these operations are linked to far-reaching
    policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on
    the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness.

        <arg n="0">their name</arg>
        <rel>implies</rel>
        <arg n="1">[ these operations] [ are linked  to far-reaching

</example>

<note>
Effectively this should be read as "their name implies that these
operations...", but Treebank uniformly does not parse it this way,
probably because of the "as".  Hence the need for the non-constituent
argument.
