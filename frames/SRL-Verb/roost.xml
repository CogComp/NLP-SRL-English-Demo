    It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share to
popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience, so the second
situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of ``chickens
coming home *trace* to roost.''

<note>

intentionality, which implies a degree of consciousness.  Yucko.
