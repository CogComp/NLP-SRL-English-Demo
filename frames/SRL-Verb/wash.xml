<note>
More than any other verb we've encountered, 'wash' has a tendency to
merge args.  Intransitively, for example, "John washed" is the same as
"John washed himself", showing that the subject of the first sentence
includes both arg0 and arg1.  Arg1 by default contains both the thing
dirty and the dirt, but those can be separated as in the "wash hands
of" example and "wash out of" example.
