    I understand John to be a complete and utter idiot.

  <arg n="2" f="PRD">to be a complete and utter idiot</arg>
</example>

<note>
The syntax will determine the difference between the first and second
examples; by all rights "John to be an idiot" should be a single
constituent which could be called Arg1 all by itself, but there might
be cases with extraction ("John was understood to be an idiot") or
other cases where the two args are separate.  Try to keep things as a
single arg, if possible, but don't use the [A] command--just use args 
--1 and 2.

    It's understood that MGM/UA recently contacted Rupert Murdoch's
    News Corp., which made two failed bids for the movie studio, to
    see if the company was still interested.

<note>
Latter examples is particularly interesting, as it's effectively
passivized, but the utterance is apparently too big to put in subject
position.  Cool.
