<text>
    Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of
    its hotel and casino businesses. 
</text>
        <arg n="0">Hilton</arg>
        <arg n="M" f="TMP">currently</arg>

        <arg n="1">bids</arg>
        <arg n="M">for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino
        businesses</arg> 
</example>

<note>
The argM in the last example should really be part of the arg1; it's
"bids for a sale..." that Hilton is soliciting; the given syntax
implies that Hilton is soliciting bids on the behalf of a sale, which
doesn't make any sense at all.
