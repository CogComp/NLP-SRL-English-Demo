second (and subsequent, if necessary) pieces of a split utterance.

  <arg n="1">John</arg>
</example>

<note>
Oh look, here's an odd usage:

John is said to be an idiot.

Effectively this is an extraction from the Arg1 &quot;utterance&quot;, which
suggests that the utterance should be regarded as TWO arguments
(object and attribute).  But that would entail retagging *every single
sentence* which we really don't want to do.  Also, notice that this
isn't a normal passive, since it can't take an agent phrase:

John is said to be an idiot by Mary.

So let's say that this is effectively a variant of &quot;call&quot; and use the
following:
</note>

<example name="call variant">
  <text>
    John is said to be an idiot.
  </text>
  <arg n="1">John</arg>
  <rel voice="passive">said</rel>
  <arg f="PRD" n="2">to be an idiot</arg>
</example>

<note>
Note:
In most cases Treebank suggests an S-BAR as the object of &quot;say&quot;; PReditor
selects the S inside the S-BAR as the Arg1.  I feel it really should be the
S-BAR, because of the cases like &quot;John said THAT he loved Mary&quot; where
the S-BAR is selected as Arg1, but in actual usage the complementizer
is usually dropped.  But since it would slow down throughput
*enormously* to retag all of these cases, we'll accept what PReditor
selects in both cases (with and without complementizer).
