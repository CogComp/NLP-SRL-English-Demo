    Where '60s dropouts professed [*-4] to scorn middle-class life and
    ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the
    upper reaches of success, it now seems that so many people feel
    they're slipping between the cracks, that middle-class life is
    viewed with nostalgia or outright longing.
