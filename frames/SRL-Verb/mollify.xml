    *trace* To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term
     value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth
     also agreed to pay as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if,
     after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company
     is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized
     from the McCaw offer.

I've always thought 'mollify' should also mean "make someone be
Molly", but that never seems to occur.
