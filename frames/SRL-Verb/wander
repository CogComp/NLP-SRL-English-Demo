##PRELIMINARY PAS LEXICAL FILE FOR "wander"
##EDITED THROUGH COMPARISON WITH THE INITIAL 25% OF "wander.sents"

## Two basic usages: wander + direction, and wander + location.

## DIRECTION:
##'in' + 'from' VARIANT

##"Antelopes wandered in from the desert." 

ARG0 REL ARGM-DIR

## LOCATION:

##'among'

##"John wandered among the workers."

ARG0 REL ARGM-LOC

##'around'

##"John wandered around Guatemala."

ARG0 REL ARGM-LOC

## Seemingly transitive:

## "John wanders the land"
Arg0 rel ArgM-LOC


## Phrasal, with a particle of end state:

##'around' + STATIVE = phrasal wander_around

##"John wandered around in a daze."
##"John wandered around confused."

ARG0 REL ARGM-MNR

##wander_off

##"John wandered off."

ARG0 REL

## plus direction:
## 'John wandered off into the distance'
ARG0 rel ARGM-DIR

## Whether you count the off as part of the ARGM-DIR depends on how
## the Treebank parses the sentence--sometimes the "off" is part of the PP,
## sometimes it's a separate particle.  If it's a separate particle make
## a phrasal verb, else count it as part of the ARGM-DIR PP.
