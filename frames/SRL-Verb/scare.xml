<note>
Unlike some of the other verbs which haven't tried to distinguish
agent and subject, you really must try with psych verbs.  It's bad
enough that we're ignoring the distinction between intentional agent
and non-intentional (but still non-instrumental) agent.  For example,
in the second example, did Mary really *mean* to scare John, or was it
an accident?  The former would make her an intentional agent, the
latter an unintentional agent.  This can only be determined by a LOT
of context, which we don't have, and even then it can be hard to tell.

This is pretty clearly an intentional subject, but scare off could
also take an unintentional subject.
