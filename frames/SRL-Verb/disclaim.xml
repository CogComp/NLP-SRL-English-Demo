    Although Section 2 of the act expressly disclaims [*] requiring
    that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices, few
    municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the
    Justice Department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal
    courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as
    possible.
