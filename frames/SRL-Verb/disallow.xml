<note>
The 'in favor of...' clause is problematic.  It's marked as -CLR in
treebank, but I think that misses the generalization that 'in favor
of' can be attached to any verb of dispreferring.  I feel 'in favor
of' to be a predicate in its own right, similar to comparatives, and
therefore safely postponed until we deal with that question.
