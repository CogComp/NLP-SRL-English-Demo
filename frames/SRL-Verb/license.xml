     Turns out that next year, Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the gang turn
     40 -- and Scripps Howard's United Media unit, the syndicator and
     licensing agent for Charles Schulz's comic strip, sees a bonanza

     advertisers for ads, tie-ins and promotions.

I have the feeling there's also an 'allow' sense, which will take
different framing, but we'll wait for an example from the corpus.
