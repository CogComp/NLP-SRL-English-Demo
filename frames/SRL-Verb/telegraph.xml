<note>
This actually conflates two very distinct senses.  One is the obvious
"send a message via telegraph".  The other is "say very succinctly".
Unfortunately, "send" and "say" take exactly opposite framing WRT
where the "receiver"/"hearer" argument goes, numerically.  But rather
than have two rolesets, identical except for this, for a low-frequency
verb, we'll conflate them and see if anyone complains.
