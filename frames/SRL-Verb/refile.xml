<note>
Sometimes the against phrase is included in the suit phrase.  You'll
therefore need to delve deeper into the syntax to divide the two args.

<example name="passivized">
  <text>
    Documents refiled *trace* with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission on the pending spinoff...

  <arg n="2" f="with">the Securities and Exchange Commission</arg>
  <arg n="m"         >on the pending spinoff</arg>
</example>

<note>
This happens a lot, with something that looks (syntactically) like an
argument of "refile" but is actually a modifier of the head NP--really 
--this is "documents on the pending spinoff were refiled with the SEC" 
--but the syntax has been bollixed.  Use ArgM for all these.

    One or more airlines have refiled for protection from creditors.

<note>
The difference between this and the Arg-4 "purpose" is that in this
case the paperwork cannot be mentioned.  With the roleset id="refile.03" above, the
paperwork need not be mentioned, but can be.  Other arguments
(refiled-with, refiled-against) will probably be mentioned.
