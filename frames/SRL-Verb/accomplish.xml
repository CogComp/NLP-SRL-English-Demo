    Our mission is to help our clients grow, and to use every tool of
    marketing communications *trace* to accomplish that.''

        <arg n="1">that</arg>
</example>

<note>
This is a bad example because it's unclear what the trace points to.
I take the trace as pointing to "we" as in "We accomplish our mission
using every tool of marketing communications."
