So one time this British gentleman took a tour of the US and visited a
farm in Iowa.  Astounded at the amount of produce being grown, he
asked the farmer what was done with the vegetables.  The farmer
replied, "We eat what we can, and what we can't we can."  The British
gent thought that was terribly clever and resolved to tell his friends
when he returned home.  When the time came, though, he couldn't quite
remember the punchline correctly and said instead, "We eat what we
can, and what we can't we do up into tins."
