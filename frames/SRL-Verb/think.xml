Oh look, here's an odd usage:

John is thought to be an idiot.

Effectively this is an extraction from the Arg1 &quot;utterance&quot;, which
suggests that the utterance should be regarded as TWO arguments
(object and attribute).  But that would entail retagging *every single
sentence* which we really don't want to do.  Also, notice that this
isn't a normal passive, since it can't take an agent phrase:

John is thought to be an idiot by Mary.

So let's say that this is effectively a variant of &quot;call&quot; and use the
following:

<example name="as variant of 'call'">
  <text>
    John is thought to be an idiot.
    Arg1 rel-passive Arg2-PRD

  <arg n="1">John</arg>
  <rel voice="pass">is thought</rel>
  <arg f="PRD" n="2">to be an idiot</arg>
