Verbnet class (relationship to point) suggests an &quot;at&quot; argument
(arg2).  This sounds a little odd to me, but possible (John shrugged
his shoulders at the thought of eternal damnation).  It is very
different from the &quot;point finger at&quot; reading, though, suggesting a
split in the class.
