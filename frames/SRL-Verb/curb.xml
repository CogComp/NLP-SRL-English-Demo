<note>
  Frames file for 'curb' based on sentences in financial subcorpus.
  No verbnet entry.  Comparison with 'reduce', but not really.  I'd
  rather have 'limit', but that hasn't been framed either.

    markets, in which traders buy and sell both for their own account
    and for clients.

<note>
I don't really expect the higher-numbered args to appear, but they're
there for reference.  Neither do I expect the sense of "please curb
