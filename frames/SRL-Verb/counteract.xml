     HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts
     that in recent quarters *trace* had counteracted interest-rate

     and lending heavily into the furious California housing market.

'prevent' predicts an arg2 "secondary predication or action", but I
don't think this will occur with 'counteract.'
