    While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the
    shift in the Treasury yield curve, underwriters continued *trace*
    to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits
    structured when the yield curve was more favorable.

There should also be a sense for 'turn violently', but it doesn't
