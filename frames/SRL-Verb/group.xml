    Shorn of all their riders, special provisions, and other bells and
    whistles, insurance policies can still be grouped [*-1] under two
    broad categories: so-called pure insurance, which amasses no cash
    value in the policy and pays off only upon death, and permanent
    insurance, which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash
    value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the
    insured is still alive.
